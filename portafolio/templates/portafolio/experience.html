    <p><h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">EDS App Backend – Robust and Scalable Architecture for Service Stations</h2>

  <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Brief Description</h3>
  <p>
    The backend of <strong>EDS App</strong> is built with <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, following a
    <em>hexagonal architecture</em> that ensures clean, decoupled, and maintainable code.
    It implements <strong>JWT</strong> for secure token-based authentication and exposes
    <strong>REST APIs</strong> documented with Swagger.
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution is optimized for production environments using <strong>Redis</strong> for data caching,
    <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and portable deployment, and <strong>AWS</strong> as the cloud platform.
    It also uses <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate CI/CD pipelines.
    All development and orchestration are managed through <strong>Visual Studio</strong>,
    providing high productivity and full control over the development lifecycle.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #2980b9;">Key Technologies</h3>
  <ul>
    <strong>Core Framework:</strong> ASP.NET Core <br>
    <strong>Security:</strong> JWT token-based authentication <br>
    <strong>API Documentation:</strong> Swagger <br>
    <strong>Performance:</strong> Redis for caching <br>
    <strong>Containers & Deployment:</strong> Docker, AWS <br>
    <strong>CI/CD Automation:</strong> GitHub Actions <br>
    <strong>Development Environment:</strong> Visual Studio <br>
    <strong>Architecture:</strong> Hexagonal – clear separation between domain,
